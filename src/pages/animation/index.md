# Animation

We are now going to add animations to our graphics library. To do this we will implement a library for processing streams of events. These systems are useful in any domain that deals with streams of IO, such as financial data, analytics, and file IO.

We'll start, as we did in the previous chapter, with some background to the problem and play around with a better solution before we come to implement it ourself.
